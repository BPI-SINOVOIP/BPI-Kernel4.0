config CC_OPTIMIZE_LIBS_FOR_SPEED
	bool "Optimize libraries for speed"
	help
	  Enabling this option will pass "-O2" to gcc when compiling
	  under "lib" directory.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	bool

config USE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	bool "Use private libgcc"
	depends on HAVE_PRIVATE_LIBGCC
	help
	  This option allows you to use the built-in libgcc implementation
	  of U-boot instead of the one privided by the compiler.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SYS_HZ
	int
	default 1000
	help
	  The frequency of the timer returned by get_timer().
	  get_timer() must operate in milliseconds and this option must be

config SHA1
	bool "Enable SHA1 support"
	help
	  This option enables support of hashing using SHA1 algorithm.
	  The hash is calculated in software.
	  The SHA1 algorithm produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value
	  (digest).

config SHA256
	bool "Enable SHA256 support"
	help
	  This option enables support of hashing using SHA256 algorithm.
	  The hash is calculated in software.
	  The SHA256 algorithm produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value
	  (digest).

config SHA_HW_ACCEL
	bool "Enable hashing using hardware"
	help
	  This option enables hardware acceleration
	  for SHA1/SHA256 hashing.
	  This affects the 'hash' command and also the
	  hash_lookup_algo() function.

config SHA_PROG_HW_ACCEL
	bool "Enable Progressive hashing support using hardware"
	depends on SHA_HW_ACCEL
	help
	  This option enables hardware-acceleration for
	  SHA1/SHA256 progressive hashing.
	  Data can be streamed in a block at a time and the hashing
	  is performed in hardware.
