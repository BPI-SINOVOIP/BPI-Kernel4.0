config VIDEO_VESA
	bool "Enable VESA video driver support"
	depends on X86
	default n
	help
	  Turn on this option to enable a very simple driver which uses vesa
	  to discover the video mode and then provides a frame buffer for use
	  by U-Boot. This can in principle be used with any platform that
	  supports PCI and video cards that support VESA BIOS Extension (VBE).

config VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828
	bool "SSD2828 bridge chip"
	default n
	---help---
	Support for the SSD2828 bridge chip, which can take pixel data coming
	from a parallel LCD interface and translate it on the fly into MIPI DSI
	interface for driving a MIPI compatible LCD panel. It uses SPI for
	configuration.

config VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828_TX_CLK
	int "SSD2828 TX_CLK frequency (in MHz)"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828
	default 0
	---help---
	The frequency of the crystal, which is clocking SSD2828. It may be
	anything in the 8MHz-30MHz range and the exact value should be
	retrieved from the board schematics. Or in the case of Allwinner
	hardware, it can be usually found as 'lcd_xtal_freq' variable in
	FEX files. It can be also set to 0 for selecting PCLK from the
	parallel LCD interface instead of TX_CLK as the PLL clock source.

config VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828_RESET
	string "RESET pin of SSD2828"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828
	default ""
	---help---
	The reset pin of SSD2828 chip. This takes a string in the format
	understood by 'name_to_gpio' function, e.g. PH1 for pin 1 of port H.

config VIDEO_LCD_HITACHI_TX18D42VM
	bool "Hitachi tx18d42vm LVDS LCD panel support"
	depends on VIDEO
	default n
	---help---
	Support for Hitachi tx18d42vm LVDS LCD panels, these panels have a
	lcd controller which needs to be initialized over SPI, once that is
	done they work like a regular LVDS panel.

config VIDEO_LCD_SPI_CS
	string "SPI CS pin for LCD related config job"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828 || VIDEO_LCD_HITACHI_TX18D42VM
	default ""
	---help---
	This is one of the SPI communication pins, involved in setting up a
	working LCD configuration. The exact role of SPI may differ for
	different hardware setups. The option takes a string in the format
	understood by 'name_to_gpio' function, e.g. PH1 for pin 1 of port H.

config VIDEO_LCD_SPI_SCLK
	string "SPI SCLK pin for LCD related config job"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828 || VIDEO_LCD_HITACHI_TX18D42VM
	default ""
	---help---
	This is one of the SPI communication pins, involved in setting up a
	working LCD configuration. The exact role of SPI may differ for
	different hardware setups. The option takes a string in the format
	understood by 'name_to_gpio' function, e.g. PH1 for pin 1 of port H.

config VIDEO_LCD_SPI_MOSI
	string "SPI MOSI pin for LCD related config job"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828 || VIDEO_LCD_HITACHI_TX18D42VM
	default ""
	---help---
	This is one of the SPI communication pins, involved in setting up a
	working LCD configuration. The exact role of SPI may differ for
	different hardware setups. The option takes a string in the format
	understood by 'name_to_gpio' function, e.g. PH1 for pin 1 of port H.

config VIDEO_LCD_SPI_MISO
	string "SPI MISO pin for LCD related config job (optional)"
	depends on VIDEO_LCD_SSD2828
	default ""
	---help---
	This is one of the SPI communication pins, involved in setting up a
	working LCD configuration. The exact role of SPI may differ for
	different hardware setups. If wired up, this pin may provide additional
	useful functionality. Such as bi-directional communication with the
	hardware and LCD panel id retrieval (if the panel can report it). The
	option takes a string in the format understood by 'name_to_gpio'
	function, e.g. PH1 for pin 1 of port H.
