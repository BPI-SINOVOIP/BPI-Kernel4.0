config DM_I2C
	bool "Enable Driver Model for I2C drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for I2C. This SPI flash interface
	  (spi_flash_probe(), spi_flash_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI flash uclass. There is one standard
	  SPI flash driver which knows how to probe most chips
	  supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_flash.h, but is currently fully compatible
	  with the old interface to avoid confusion and duplication
	  during the transition parent. SPI and SPI flash must be
	  enabled together (it is not possible to use driver model
	  for one and not the other).

config DM_I2C_COMPAT
	bool "Enable I2C compatibility layer"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable old-style I2C functions for compatibility with existing code.
	  This option can be enabled as a temporary measure to avoid needing
	  to convert all code for a board in a single commit. It should not
	  be enabled for any board in an official release.

config SYS_I2C_UNIPHIER
	bool "UniPhier I2C driver"
	depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER && DM_I2C
	default y
	help
	  Support for Panasonic UniPhier I2C controller driver.  This I2C
	  controller is used on PH1-LD4, PH1-sLD8 or older UniPhier SoCs.

config SYS_I2C_UNIPHIER_F
	bool "UniPhier FIFO-builtin I2C driver"
	depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER && DM_I2C
	default y
	help
	  Support for Panasonic UniPhier FIFO-builtin I2C controller driver.
	  This I2C controller is used on PH1-Pro4 or newer UniPhier SoCs.
